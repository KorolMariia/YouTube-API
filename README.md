# YouTube-API
[Demo](https://you-tube-api-six.vercel.app/)

Here, you can:

- search videos;
- watch videos;
- choose other videos from the suggested ones.

## This project was bootstrapped with ReactJS class component.

I used:

- ReactJS: class component
- Material-UI
- Youtube API
- Axios
- Versel for Demo

#### To start the app do (development):

Firstly, you must add the file **.env** with your Youtube API access key.

> Note: You can generate it in the Google Developer Console.

You can see the file **.env-sample** - a sample of what it should look.

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm start
```
